Physical Datastructures- decides how the memory is handled  - Array, LinkedList
Logical Datastructures- implemented using Physical Datastructures, - Stack , Queues, Trees, Graph, HashTables

Datatype
    representation of datatype
    operation of datatype

    eg: int - 1st bit is forn sign
              operations - +,-,*,/,%

ADT - Abstract Datatype
eg: List - represented by array or LinkedList
           operations - add, remove, search...

a class with representation and operations becomes ADT

TIME COMPLEXITY -Time required to complete the task
here we use steps because different computer process in different Time
    O(1)
    O(logn)
    O(n) - order of n 
    O(nlogn)
    O(n^2)
    O(n!)

SPACE COMPLEXITY - Space required for an algorithm
